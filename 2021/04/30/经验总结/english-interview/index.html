        <h2 id="Introduce-yourself"><a href="#Introduce-yourself" class="headerlink" title="Introduce yourself"></a>Introduce yourself</h2><p>Respected professors, Good morning/afternoon: My name is Wu Di. It is really a great honor to have this opportunity for a interview, I would like to answer whatever you may raise, and I hope I can make a good performance today.</p>
<span id="more"></span>

<p> Now I will introduce myself briefly, I am 26 years old, born in Shangqiu, Henan province. I have graduated from Beihang University at 2020, my major is <strong>Aerospace Engineering</strong>. In the past 3 years, I spent most of my time on studying. I have published three academic papers and one patent which are deep learning related. Besides, I have  also taken a tour to some big factories and companies when I was a master student. So I have acquired basic knowledge of deep learning in both theory and practice. And I currently working at Chinese PLA General Hospital as an algorithm engineer, where I mainly focus on how to use deep learning methods for precise medical treatment which is convenient to doctors and patients. During my job, I engaged in developing deep learning methods and responsible for the analysing of continuous biomedical signal including ECG, respiration signal, blood pressure, pluse and three-axis acceleration etc. For example, I proposed an algorithm based on YOLO which is a famous object detection method to localize the <strong>sleep apnea events</strong> during sleep. The main character of our method is, it is a 1 dimension signal suitable neural network which can predict not only where these events happened but also get the confidence of how possible they would happen.</p>
<p>Besides, my research area also include hand-gesture recognize based on EMG, signal quality assessment based on unsupervised learning and analysis of electronic medical records. Thank you!</p>
<h2 id="What-is-your-greatest-strength"><a href="#What-is-your-greatest-strength" class="headerlink" title="What is your greatest strength?"></a>What is your greatest strength?</h2><p>I feel that my strongest asset is my ability to stick to things to get them done. I feel a real sense of<br> accomplishment when I finish a thing and it turns out just as I’d planned. I’ve set some high goals<br> for myself. For example, I want to graduate with highest distinction. And even though I had a slow<br> start in my freshman year, I made up for it by doing an honor’s thesis.</p>
<h2 id="What-is-your-greatest-weakness"><a href="#What-is-your-greatest-weakness" class="headerlink" title="What is your greatest weakness?"></a>What is your greatest weakness?</h2><p>I am a perfectionist and I pay very much attention to details. Sometimes I am quite captious.</p>
<h2 id="xx-How-do-you-feel-about-your-progress-to-date"><a href="#xx-How-do-you-feel-about-your-progress-to-date" class="headerlink" title="xx How do you feel about your progress to date?"></a>xx How do you feel about your progress to date?</h2><p>Honestly speaking I am quite content with my progress in my university studies. As a freshman in deep learning, I have accumulated considerable professional knowledge for prospective application. Besides, I made use of the extra curricular life in the university to do some meaningful things such as traveling, participating in academic forum, applying for internship in related studios as well as reading classic guides of designing, which not only broadened my horizon but also made me have a better understanding of what I have learned. I have become a student who gets more interested in what he majors in and knows what to do to improve himself.</p>
<p>Satisfiedas I am in terms of my previous improvement, I do have to admit that there are much I can do in the future. First of all, I am not familiar with the whole designing procedure of constructing a new building, which is crucial for aqualified architect. Moreover, I should improve my sketching skills to make sure that my ideas can be understood correctly. Thirdly, learning more architecture styles is also of vital importance because only by acquiring more styles can I find mine in the future. Furthermore, improving the understanding of interior designing can help me with comprehending the relationship between interior decoration and exterior design. Knowing what I have done and how Ishould do to improve myself give me the confidence to dig in my major, I believe that I will gain satisfactory achievements in the future.</p>
<h2 id="What-has-been-your-greatest-accomplishment"><a href="#What-has-been-your-greatest-accomplishment" class="headerlink" title="What has been your greatest accomplishment?"></a><del>What has been your greatest accomplishment?</del></h2><p> <del>My greatest accomplishment is that I was enrolled by China Agricultural University in 2009.</del></p>
<h2 id="Tell-me-about-your-family"><a href="#Tell-me-about-your-family" class="headerlink" title="Tell me about your family."></a>Tell me about your family.</h2><p> There are three people in my family. My parents are workers, though they have not recived college education,  their honest and candid impress me a lot.</p>

Divide time into several time periods each day, and I will do different jobs at different times.</p>

Then I will summarize the methods and experience to solve this kind of problem. On the basis of this, I try to propose new solutions.</p>
<h2 id="xx-Describe-your-experimental-skills"><a href="#xx-Describe-your-experimental-skills" class="headerlink" title="xx Describe your experimental skills."></a>xx Describe your experimental skills.</h2><p> During the past three years, under the strict guidance of my supervisor, I have learned systematically the theory of profession and got the basic manipulative skills about the analysis of veterinary drugs. I have successfully finished the subject “Pharmacokinetics and pharmadynamics study of compound amoxicillin intramammary infusion in lactating cows after repeated administrations”and grasped some experimental skills, such as sample extraction, sample clean-up, instrument operation.</p>
<h2 id="What’s-your-hobby"><a href="#What’s-your-hobby" class="headerlink" title="What’s your hobby?"></a>What’s your hobby?</h2><p> In my spare time, I like reading and travel. Reading makes me intelligent and travel broaden my horizens.</p>

First, he has a profound academic standards and he is responsive. Second, There is a high level of professional construction, especially, the biomedical engineer is ranked in the first few in the country. Third, I am also graduated from Beihang University and I am familiar with our school, so I plan to study here in the future.</p>
<h2 id="xxHow-will-you-plan-to-devote-to-your-potential-programme"><a href="#xxHow-will-you-plan-to-devote-to-your-potential-programme" class="headerlink" title="xxHow will you plan to devote to your potential programme?"></a>xxHow will you plan to devote to your potential programme?</h2><p>PhD degree is not a ticket that youjust do. A PhD is training on how to think, how to learn, and how to doresearch of sufficient quality that it contributes to the field that the PhD isin. I must think and plan everything efficiently and earlier. Problem solving skill/time management.</p>
<p>During myMsc degree, besides compulsory modules which were already about the current hot topics, I have been to several seminars which interested me.</p>
<p>There were so many seminars relatedto malaria, such as Gene drive for population suppression of the malaria mosquito</p>
<p>Investigating signalling molecules essential formalaria parasite infection and transmission</p>
<h2 id="Why-phd"><a href="#Why-phd" class="headerlink" title="Why phd?"></a>Why phd?</h2><p>There are several reasons accounting for my endeavor. Above all, I have been deeply impressed by the academic atmosphere. I feel so satisfied and pleasure after I finish my project write-up. I want to publish papers to prove myself. I enjoy the life as a researcher. Secondly, though I learnt a lot from my master study during the past 3 years. However, I think further study is still urgent for me to realize self-value. Life is precious. It is necessary to seize any chance for self-development, especially in this competitive modern world. In a word, I am looking forward to making a solid foundation for future profession after several years study here.</p>
